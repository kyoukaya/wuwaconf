A simple web Wuthering Waves FPS Unlocker inspired by [WakuWakuPadoru's FPS unlocker](https://github.com/WakuWakuPadoru/WuWa_Simple_FPSUnlocker). Drag and drop your LocalStorage.db file onto the page, tweak the configuration, and download the modified file all in your browser without any downloads and without your data leaving your computer.

## Instructions

1. Head over to https://wuwa.kyou.dev
2. Drag and drop your `LocalStorage.db` file onto the page.
3. Tweak the configuration.
4. Click "Download Modified File" and replace the `LocalStorage.db` file in your game folder.

## Why did you make this?

There's lots of existing and popular ways to do this. But I personally dislike downloading a program just to modify a *tiny database* by an even *tinier* amount. Typing `sqlite3 LocalStorage.db` is too much effort of course.
